## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

The Smart Crop Advisory System (SCAS) is a community-based, AI-powered, low-cost advisory platform designed to help small and marginal farmers make data-driven farming decisions. It integrates IoT sensors, weather data, and AI-driven analytics to offer personalized crop advisories in regional languages through mobile apps, SMS, and voice calls.

How it Addresses the Problem:

Provides timely and localized advice on irrigation, fertilizer use, and pest management.

Works even in low-connectivity and low-literacy environments using IVR and voice-based systems.

Reduces costs for farmers through shared sensor hubs and offline-first mobile support.

Empowers farmers to make scientific and sustainable decisions, increasing yield and resource efficiency.

Innovation and Uniqueness:

Shared Sensor Hubs: One set of IoT sensors serves multiple farmers, minimizing per-farmer cost.

Offline-First AI Advisory: Runs light ML models locally to provide instant feedback.

Micro-Advisory Model: Delivers 1–2 simple, actionable instructions per day to avoid information overload.

Voice-First Communication: Uses local languages and IVR for inclusivity.

Human-in-the-Loop Feedback: Farmer and extension worker feedback improves model accuracy continuously.

## Technical Approach

Technologies to be Used:

Hardware: ESP32-based sensor hub (soil moisture, temperature, EC sensors), Raspberry Pi or Android phone as gateway.

Software Stack: Python (backend & ML), TensorFlow Lite (AI), Node.js (API services), PostgreSQL (database).

Mobile Interfaces: Android (Kotlin/Flutter) + IVR/SMS integration.

Cloud Services: AWS or open-source Kubernetes cluster for scalable data processing.

Methodology and Process for Implementation:

  C --> A[Mobile App / IVR / SMS]
  A --> F[Farmer Feedback]
  F --> C

Process Steps:

IoT sensors gather real-time field data.

Data is sent to the edge gateway for local processing.

Cloud ML models combine weather, satellite, and sensor data.

The advisory system generates a personalized micro-advisory.

Farmer receives the advisory via app, SMS, or IVR.

Feedback and outcomes are recorded for future improvements.

## Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility Analysis:

Technically Feasible: Uses affordable hardware, scalable cloud systems, and proven IoT & AI tech.

Economically Viable: Shared sensor hubs reduce setup cost; ongoing cost < ₹80 per farmer/month.

Operationally Practical: Works in rural conditions with offline-first features.


Challenges and Risks:

Limited Internet Access: Could delay data sync.

Sensor Maintenance: Physical damage or calibration issues.

Adoption Barriers: Farmers’ reluctance to trust automated systems.


Strategies to Overcome Challenges:

Offer SMS/voice-based alternatives for offline operation.

Use community-owned sensors to ensure collective care.

Conduct training and demonstration sessions to build farmer trust.

## Impact and Benefits

Potential Impact:

Empowers small and marginal farmers with data-driven, localized decision support.

Bridges the knowledge gap in agriculture using AI and IoT.

Reduces overuse of water, pesticides, and fertilizers.

Benefits:

Social: Enhances farmer confidence and livelihood stability.

Economic: Increases yield and reduces resource wastage.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming by optimizing resource use.
